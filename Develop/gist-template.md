## Regex Components

### Anchors

^ this is an anchor. This component is used to match the exact start of our search word. For example, in this case ^ is preceeded with the # and only. So, we will match:

```
#234
#Banana
#Whatever
```

But not:

```
234#
234
2#34
```

### a-f0-9

a-f This means that we would like to have any lowercase letter between a and f included:

```
a b c d e f
```

0-9 means that we expect any number beetween 0 and 9.

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

### []

Everything that goes inside the square brackets can be written in any order.

For instance, [0-9] will match:

```
1
2
3
4...
```

{3}

### Character Classes

With character classes, the regex engine will only match with one of several different character. These are useed commonly.

### Flags

JS only has 6 different flags (i, g, m, s, u, and y). These are ways to specify what type of matches a search will yield.

### Grouping and Capturing

Capturing groups are placed within parentheses() and are used as a way to treat groups of characters as one single character.

### Bracket Expressions

A backet expression will match a specific set of single characters and has the possibility of matching multi character elements depending on what is contained in the expression.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
